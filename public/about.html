  <h1>About Me</h1>

    I consider myself a creative technologist, who will
    never be finished learning until the day I die.
    I grew up in a family entrenched in the performing
    arts, my late father a concert violinist and my late
    mother, a concert pianist. As we grew up, my siblings
    and I branched out into experimental theatre and opera.
    I continue to perform in New York theatrical venues and
    tour abroad to this day. As the clich√© goes, the arts
    very rarely provide adequate financial support.
  </p>
    I embarked on an autodidactic odyssey in the study of
    information teaching myself both the rudiments and some
    more advanced skills that led to consulting work. As
    interesting as I found the technology, the creative spirit
    within me insisted that I find an aesthetically creative
    field in digital media&mdash;both desktop publishing and,
    in the early 2000s, web development and design.
  
  <p>
    Over the ensuing years, I learned a great deal, but found
    that my autodidactic journey was reaching diminishing
    returns and I needed to seek out a learning community
    where I could formalize my training a bit more. Nonetheless,
    in the period that preceeded, I consistently defied the
    conventional wisdom that one must specialize exclusively in
    front- or back-end development and design. This militated
    against my need to understand the inner workings of things
    rather than essentially painting by number.

    In 2011, I graduated summa cum laude with a BS in
    Integrated Web Development & Design from the
    CUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary
    Studies, with Hunter College as my home school in
    the program. Still not satisfied with the gaps in
    my knowledge, this was followed by some continuing
    education courses, and finally my completion of an
    MS in Integrated Digital Media from NYU Tandon
    School of Engineering in 2017.

    I continue self-study on a daily basis to augment
    an education that far too often cut corners around
    project-based learning. Nonetheless I have produced
    some projects of which I can be proud. This site
    hearkens back to the era at the dawn of HTML, when
    very limited styling options were available and
    were combined as attributes in HTML tags. But it
    stands as an example of the simple beauty of the
    information architecture that organizes content into
    a comprehensible whole.
