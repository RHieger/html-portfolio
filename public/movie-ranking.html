   <p>
      An incredible tour de force of cinematic writing,
      directing and acting, this film succeeded in doing
      the unthinkable&mdash;treating the prospect of world
      thermonuclear war as comedy. Of course, it is a very
      dark, black comedic treatment, but hysterically funny,
      nonetheless. Additionally, it is a profound anti-war
      statement, not the first released by Director
      Stanley Kubrick.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The film was completed at the height of the Cold War in
      1963 and originally intended for release that year. But
      the real-world tragedy on November 22, 1963&mdash;the
      assasination of President Kennedy&mdash;made the release
      far too controversial given the turmoil immediately
      following Kennedy's death, and the continued fears of
      nuclear weapons proliferation. The film was released
      instead on January 29, 1964.

    <h3>Paths of Glory</h3>

    <h4>
      Screenplay: Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham and
      Jim Thompson<br />
      Director: Stanley Kubrick
    </h4>

    <p>
      Released in 1957, and also directed by Stanley Kubrick,
      this film, starring Kirk Douglas, dared to show the
      horrors of trench warfare during World War I (The Great
      War or The War to End All Wars, as it was known at the
      time). It is a great anti-war statement which preceded
      that shown in Dr. Strangelove.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story centers around "Colonel Dax, the commanding
      officer of French soldiers who refuse to continue a
      suicidal attack, after which Dax attempts to defend
      them against charges of cowardice in a
      court-martial" (Wikipedia).

    <h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>

    <h4>
      Screenplay: Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and
      Edgar Allan Woolf<br />
      Director: Victor Fleming
    </h4>

    <p>
      Released in 1939, the year Hitler invaded Poland, this
      timeless classic, no doubt, provided many with a respite
      from the increasingly grim news coming out of Europe.
      The film never gets old on repeated viewing, and tells
      the story of Dorothy, whose dog Toto is accused by Almira
      Gulch of having bitten her. The wealthy Gulch obtains an
      order from the local sherriff allowing her to destory
      the dog.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Dorothy runs away with Toto to protect him from Mrs.
      Gulch and gets caught in a tornado. When she returns
      home, she is struck in the head by a window that flies
      off the house and is she is knocked unconscious. In her
      vision, Mrs. Gulch turns into the Wicked Witch of the
      West, who pursues her through the magical land of Oz
      trying to avenge the death of her sister, an act that
      she blames on Dorothy.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the many distinctions of this story of magical
      realism brought to film is that this is the first film
      in history to use technicolor.

    <h3>Amadeus</h3>

    <h4>
      Screenplay: Peter Shaffer<br />
      Director: Milo&scaron; Forman
    </h4>

    <img src="../images/amadeus.jpg" width="300"
     alt="Poster of Amadeus" />

    <p>
      Released in 1984, Amadeus is a fictionalized
      accounting of the trials and tribulations of
      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the devious plot of
      Antonio Salieri, contemporary composer in
      Mozart's time, to kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story, told throgh the eyes of Italian composer
      Salieri, includes many selections of both Mozart's
      and Salieri's composition. The part of Mozart was
      masterfully portrayed by Tom Hulce, and Salieri,
      played by F. Murray Abraham, earned him the Academy
      Award for Best Actor.

    <h3>Topsy Turvy</h3>
    
    <h4>Screenplay and Direction: Mike Leigh</h4>

    <img src="../images/topsy-turvy.jpg" width="300"
     alt="Poster of Topsy-Turvy" />
    
    <p>
      Topsy Turvy, released in 1999, directed and written
      by Mike Leigh, chronicles the relationship between
      composer Arthur Sullivan and playwright/librettist
      W.S. (William Schwenk) Gilbert. Filled with the poignant
      struggles of historic figures of some performers of the
      D'Oyle Carte Opera company, the film centers around the
      tumultuous process of creating one of their most
      beloved satirical operettas, The Mikado.
    </p>


    <p>
      Set in Japan, the Mikado is perhaps more acurately
      characterized as a biting satirical look at bourgeois
      English society of the Victorian era.
